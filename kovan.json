        "markdown": "[Kovan](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal) is the community driven test network that runs on the Parity [Aura](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Aura) proof-of-authority consensus engine.\n\nWith a consistent 4 second blocktime, immunity to proof-of-work spam attacks, the network allows developers to develop their applications on a reliable platform. While in an early phase, it already has proven itself to be consistent and available, with all the tools you have come to expect from a testnet ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more, read the original [press release](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/parity-pushes-new-ethereum-testnet-kovan-after-spam-attacks-1609901) or join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/Lobby)."

        "markdown": "On Wednesday 19th July, 2017 a bug found in the multi-signature wallet ('multi-sig') code used as part of Parity Wallet software was exploited by parties unknown. As of the time of writing, three wallet accounts holding large balances of ETH have been compromised and the balances moved into accounts held by the attacker. The self-titled 'White Hat Group' used the same exploit to secure the other compromised wallets within Ethereum, with the stated intention of returning control to the original owners.\n\nRead the full [security alert](https://blog.parity.io/security-alert-high-2/), the [postmortem](https://blog.parity.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/), and learn about our new [bug bounty program](https://blog.parity.io/announcing-parity-bug-bounty-program/) on our blog."

The [Parity wiki](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki) should be the first stop for any general questions in running the software, configuring it or just trying out some of the basic or advanced features of Parity, either as a user, developer or miner.\n\nIf you prefer direct interaction with the team, join us on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/paritytech/parity) and feel free to ask any questions."

        "markdown": "A quick update on the status of Parity Ethereum client.\n\n**Bug Bounty.** There is now a significant amount in our [bug bounty](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00f1c77935ac482fc075b55b5990e86ea40851bb) programme (many thanks to all contributors). As mentioned in a previous post, critical security bugs in the latest versions of Parity, both beta and stable branches, are valid targets for bounty-collecting reports. The multi-sig wallet, in particular, should be considered a prime target for review and any significant bug will attract a large proportion of the bounty. Any bugs found should be reported to security@parity.io.\n\n**Multi-sig Wallet.** Several minor changes have been made to the Parity multi-sig, mainly to enable compilation by later versions of Solidity. We understand the "white hat group" is using this code to return some of the funds they temporarily commandeered. After [code reviews](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/pull/48) by many of our developers, there are no known issues. The bug bounty programme is active and we have so far had no issues reported.\n\n**Please Upgrade!** Though we try to be as thorough as a bleeding-edge software project can be, bugs sometimes creep into our codebase and, as recent events show, left unchecked these can have significant impacts in the wild. Older versions of Parity can have known bugs (generally mentioned in the release notes): if you are using Parity for anything of any significant value please do ensure that you are running the latest version to minimise the chances of any problems and establish procedures according to the value as risk.\n\nRead the full [security update](https://blog.parity.io/security-update/), the [postmortem](https://blog.parity.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/) of the recent hacks, and learn about our new [bug bounty program](https://blog.parity.io/announcing-parity-bug-bounty-program/) on our blog."

        "markdown": "[Kovan](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal) is the community driven test network that runs on the Parity [Aura](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Aura) proof-of-authority consensus engine.\n\nWith a consistent 4 second blocktime, immunity to proof-of-work spam attacks, the network allows developers to develop their applications on a reliable platform. While in an early phase, it already has proven itself to be consistent and available, with all the tools you have come to expect from a testnet ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more, read the original [press release](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/parity-pushes-new-ethereum-testnet-kovan-after-spam-attacks-1609901) or join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/Lobby)."

The [Parity wiki](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki) should be the first stop for any general questions in running the software, configuring it or just trying out some of the basic or advanced features of Parity, either as a user, developer or miner.\n\nIf you prefer direct interaction with the team, join us on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/paritytech/parity) and feel free to ask any questions."

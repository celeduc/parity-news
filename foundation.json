        "markdown": "With the Parity 1.7 release we are proud to announce experimental support for light clients and web wallets. The light synchronization mode can be enabled by starting Parity with `--light`. The web wallet is a public Parity node that keeps the keys and signs transactions using your local browser storage. Try it at [wallet.parity.io](https://wallet.parity.io) or run your own with the `--public-node` command-line flag. Other important features are the experimental WASM contract support, the PubSub API and separate signer apps for iOS and Android.\n\nTo get an overview of everything included, read the [release accouncement](https://blog.parity.io/) on our blog."

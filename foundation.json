        "markdown": "On Wednesday 19th July, 2017 a bug found in the multi-signature wallet ('multi-sig') code used as part of Parity Wallet software was exploited by parties unknown. As of the time of writing, three wallet accounts holding large balances of ETH have been compromised and the balances moved into accounts held by the attacker. The self-titled 'White Hat Group' used the same exploit to secure the other compromised wallets within Ethereum, with the stated intention of returning control to the original owners.\n\nRead the full [security alert](https://blog.parity.io/security-alert-high-2/), the [postmortem](https://blog.parity.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/), and learn about our new [bug bounty program](https://blog.parity.io/announcing-parity-bug-bounty-program/) on our blog."

        "markdown": "A quick update on the status of Parity Ethereum client.\n\n**Bug Bounty.** There is now a significant amount in our [bug bounty](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00f1c77935ac482fc075b55b5990e86ea40851bb) programme (many thanks to all contributors). As mentioned in a previous post, critical security bugs in the latest versions of Parity, both beta and stable branches, are valid targets for bounty-collecting reports. The multi-sig wallet, in particular, should be considered a prime target for review and any significant bug will attract a large proportion of the bounty. Any bugs found should be reported to security@parity.io.\n\n**Multi-sig Wallet.** Several minor changes have been made to the Parity multi-sig, mainly to enable compilation by later versions of Solidity. We understand the "white hat group" is using this code to return some of the funds they temporarily commandeered. After [code reviews](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/pull/48) by many of our developers, there are no known issues. The bug bounty programme is active and we have so far had no issues reported.\n\n**Please Upgrade!** Though we try to be as thorough as a bleeding-edge software project can be, bugs sometimes creep into our codebase and, as recent events show, left unchecked these can have significant impacts in the wild. Older versions of Parity can have known bugs (generally mentioned in the release notes): if you are using Parity for anything of any significant value please do ensure that you are running the latest version to minimise the chances of any problems and establish procedures according to the value as risk.\n\nRead the full [security update](https://blog.parity.io/security-update/), the [postmortem](https://blog.parity.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/) of the recent hacks, and learn about our new [bug bounty program](https://blog.parity.io/announcing-parity-bug-bounty-program/) on our blog."

        "markdown": "We are pleased to [announce](https://github.com/ethereum/ropsten/blob/master/revival.md) that the Ropsten testnet has been revived! Thanks to a generous donation of GPU hashpower, the Ropsten chain has been cleared of the spam blocks that had accumulated in a [recent attack](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/12477).\n\nWhile there is a trend toward adoption of alternative [proof-of-authority](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Proof-of-Authority-Chains) consensus protocols for Ethereum testnets, such as [Kovan](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal), Ropsten as a public proof-of-work Ethereum testnet remains relevant for multiple reasons.\n\nSince the Ethereum mainnet still operates based on PoW consensus, a PoW testnet best reproduces the current production environment, i.e. system and network conditions on the live Ethereum mainnet. Thus, Ropsten is useful for experiments to investigate certain issues that we observe today on the mainnet, such as the relation between uncle rates and gas prices. And for Dapp developers, Ropsten is useful for realistic tests of back-end performance (i.e. mainnet transactions and block times) and front-end user experience.
